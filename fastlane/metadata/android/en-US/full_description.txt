Cross-platform hierarchical note taking application with focus on building large personal knowledge bases.

This is a port of the desktop application TriliumNext Notes.
These features of the original are implemented:

- Synchronisation with sync server / desktop app
- Notes can be arranged into arbitrarily deep tree, where single notes can be placed into multiple places in the tree
- WYSIWYG note editor based on CKEditor
- Fast and easy navigation between notes
- Automatic note versioning
- Note attributes and relations for organization, querying and advanced scripting
- Note encryption with per-note granularity
- Canvas notes powered by Excalidraw
- Note map view (context-based / all notes)

The following features are only available in the desktop client.
They will be implemented in the app at a later time.

- Full text search
- Sharing (publishing) notes to public internet
- Relation maps and link maps for visualizing notes and their relations
- REST API for automation
