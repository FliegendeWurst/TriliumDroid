- Note attributes and relations for organization, querying and advanced scripting
- Note encryption with per-note granularity
- Canvas notes powered by [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)

More features are planned, see the [issue tracker](https://github.com/FliegendeWurst/TriliumDroid/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc%20is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aenhancement) for a full list.

### Android integration

- Note content can be shared to other apps
- Received shared content is saved as new note
- Translated UI: English, German, Turkish, Chinese (Simplified Han script)
- Light/Dark Theme following system preference

### Requirements

- Sync server running TriliumNext/Trilium (any version from 0.93.0 to 0.63.7)
- Android 7.0+

For using the app without a sync server, follow [this issue](https://github.com/FliegendeWurst/TriliumDroid/issues/75).  
If you're still using Android 6.0 or older, see [this issue](https://github.com/FliegendeWurst/TriliumDroid/issues/72).  
For other ways to use Trilium on mobile, see https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/issues/72.

## Installation

If you already have [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) installed, you can add [IzzyOnDroid's F-Droid repository](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/) in F-Droid's settings. Then install the app like any other.

Or if you prefer to install the app directly:

1. Download the APK from [IzzyOnDroid](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/eu.fliegendewurst.triliumdroid).
2. Install the APK. You need to enable installing apps from unknown sources.
3. Open the app and configure your sync server (hostname, port, password).
4. Go back, wait until sync is finished.

Several parts of the user interface are configurable, check the app settings for more details.
To edit notes, use the edit button in the toolbar.
