- Sync with other Trilium instance (push + pull)
- Displaying/editing/sharing note content
- Displaying/editing note attributes (labels and relations)
- Attribute inheritance and templating
- Displaying note icon
- Displaying note paths
- Displaying/collapsing/expanding note tree
- Navigating using internal links
- Browsing external links

- Local/global note map view

## Usage

1. Download the app from [IzzyOnDroid](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/eu.fliegendewurst.triliumdroid).
2. Install the APK. You need to enable installing apps from unknown sources.
3. Open the app and configure your sync server (hostname, port, password).
4. Go back, wait until sync is finished.

Then, you can:

- inspect and navigate the note tree by opening the left side bar
- view and modify note attributes by opening the right side bar
- jump to notes using the floating action button in the bottom right corner
- edit notes using the edit button in the top action bar

There is also some preliminary support for scripting, but it doesn't work exactly like the Trilium API at the moment.

## TODO

- Search
- Folder view of child nodes
- Jump to note dialog: smart sort

- Support for Android <= 6.0 (very low priority)
- Special layout for tablet screens
- F-Droid compatible gradle repositories (AztecEditor is not in Maven Central)
